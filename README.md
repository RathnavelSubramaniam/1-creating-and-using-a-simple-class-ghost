Practical 1: Creating and Using a Simple Class
Task 1: Creating the Person Class
● Create a Java class named Person.
● Add instance variables for firstName (String), lastName (String), and age (int).
● Create a default constructor to initialize these variables.
● Implement a parameterized constructor to set the values for firstName,
lastName, and age.
● Implement a method called getFullName that returns the full name
(concatenation of firstName and lastName).
Task 2: Using the Person Class
● In the main method, create two Person objects with the following data:
○ Person 1: First Name = "John", Last Name = "Doe", Age = 30
○ Person 2: First Name = "Alice", Last Name = "Smith", Age = 25
● Display the full names and ages of both persons using the getFullName method.
● Calculate and display the average age of the two persons.
Task 3: Additional Operations
● Implement a method in the Person class to check if a person is a teenager (age
between 13 and 19).
● Create a new Person object with age 18 and use the method to check if they are
a teenager.
● Modify the Person class to include a toString method that returns a formatted
string representation of a person's information.
● Display the formatted information of all created persons using the toString
method.
